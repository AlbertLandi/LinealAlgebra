# LinearAlgebra
A simple Power Iteration Java code with I/O via console, made using Object Oriented Programming. It includes a Matrix Class that handles all the Calculus, 
and a Controller Class that contains the I/O logic. 

## What's Power Iteration?

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_iteration), in mathematics, power iteration (also known as the power method) is an eigenvalue algorithm: 
given a diagonalizable matrix A, the algorithm will produce a number λ, which is the greatest (in absolute value) eigenvalue of A, and a nonzero vector v, 
which is a corresponding eigenvector of λ, that is, Av = λ. The algorithm is also known as the Von Mises iteration.

Power iteration is a very simple algorithm, but it may converge slowly. The most time-consuming operation of the algorithm is the multiplication of matrix A 
by a vector, so it is effective for a very large sparse matrix with appropriate implementation.
